# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Back to the basics. Starting with FreeCodeCamp's coding curriculum.

**Thoughts:** I got a little bored at some points, but it was good to review some of the basic fundamentals of HTML and CSS.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
