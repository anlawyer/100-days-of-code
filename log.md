# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Back to the basics. Starting with FreeCodeCamp's coding curriculum.

**Thoughts:** I got a little bored at some points, but it was good to review some of the basic fundamentals of HTML and CSS.

### Day 3: February 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Getting down in portfolio town, part 3.

**Thoughts:**: Added cards instead of the open columns style I had earlier. Still not 100% satisfied with the design. Lots more work to do, especially to add individual pages for bigger projects.

### Day 4: February 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Updated hangman game to ES6.

**Thoughts:**: More to do regarding gameplay and logic... still some bugs to squash. Interesting to see how far I've come since my first game I made back in July '17!

### Day 5: February 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Began Advanced Web Dev online course.

**Thoughts:**: Having trouble finding time to code, network, improve skills, refine online presence, and sleep. Having trouble deciding which tech to learn/focus on at one time!

**Link to work:** I want to learn everything.

### Day 6: February 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: React refresher at a Meetup. Learned about making a "hackable" boilerplate for React with Webpack and Babel (as opposed to FB's monsterous create-react-app).

**Thoughts:**: SO MUCH TO LEARN AND DO. I really want to learn and become good at so much about this career/hobby/lifestyle. I have a lot to work on and I will continue to do so until I get where I want to be.
